## Container sample: Run a simple application

You can quickly run a container with a pre-built [.NET Framework Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-framework-samples/), based on the [.NET Framework console sample](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/blob/master/samples/dotnetapp/README.md).

Type the following command to run a sample console application:

```console
docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/samples:dotnetapp
```
