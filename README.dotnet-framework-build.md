# What is the .NET Framework?

The [.NET Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/framework) is a general purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft. It is the most popular way to build client and server applications for Windows and Windows Server. It is included with Windows, Windows Server and Windows Server Core. It includes server technologies such as ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC and Windows Communication Framework (WCF) applications, which you can run in Docker containers.

.NET has several capabilities that make development easier, including automatic memory management, (runtime) generic types, reflection, asynchrony, concurrency, and native interop. Millions of developers take advantage of these capabilities to efficiently build high-quality web and client applications.

You can use C#, F# and VB to write .NET Framework apps. C# is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented while retaining the expressiveness and elegance of C-style languages. F# is a multi-paradigm programming language, enabling both functional and object-oriented patterns and practices. VB is a rapid development programming language with the deepest integration between the language and Visual Studio, providing the fastest path to a working app.   

The .NET Framework was first released by Microsoft in 2001. The latest version is [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/framework).

# How to use these Images

These images are based on [Windows Containers][win-containers]. You need to be Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 to use them.

## Building a .NET Framework 4.x application with a multi-stage Dockerfile

.NET Framework Docker images can utilize the [multi-stage build feature](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/multistage-build/). This feature allows multiple FROM instructions to be used in one Dockerfile. Using this feature, you can build a .NET Framework app using an build image and then copy the published app into a lighter weight runtime image within a single Dockerfile.

1. Add a `Dockerfile` file with the following content to your project. The `Dockerfile` and the Docker commands assume that your application is called `dotnetapp.exe`. Please update your `Dockerfile` as appropriate.

    ```dockerfile
    FROM microsoft/dotnet-framework-build:4.7.1 AS build-env
    
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    
    RUN msbuild.exe /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release /p:OutputPath=out
    
    FROM microsoft/dotnet-framework:4.7.1
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY --from=build-env /app/out ./
    ENTRYPOINT ["dotnetapp.exe"]
    ```

2. Type the following Docker commands at the command line, within your project directory (beside Program.cs). You can change the tag name (`dotnetapp`) to your own string, as you like.

    ```console
    docker build -t dotnetapp .
    docker run --rm dotnetapp
    ```

The Docker runtime image used in this example includes the .NET Framework 4.7.1, however, your application does not need to explicity target the .NET Framework 4.7.1. Applications that target .NET Framework 4.0 or later should work correctly with this image.

## Image variants

The `microsoft/dotnet-framework-build` images come in different flavors, each designed for a specific use case.

### `4.7.1`

This image is for building .NET Framework 4.x version applications. It is based on the [Windows Server Core image](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windowsservercore/).
